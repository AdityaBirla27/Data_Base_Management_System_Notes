					View

It is a logical table which is created from one or more tables or from another view.
View doesn't contain its own data.
View is a window through which we can access data from tables.

Advantages:

1. It provides security
2. It makes complex query easy
3. We can create any no of views from one or more tables

Syntax:

create [or replace] view view_name
as
select statement

e.g.

create view emp
as
select id,name,dept
from employee


There are 2 types of views:

1. Simple view:can be created from single table and not used group functions, group by clause, joins

2. Complex view: group functions(max, min, avg, count, sum), group by clause, joins


2 tables:

employee
dept

create table dept
(
did number(2) primary key,
dname varchar2(20))

create or replace view emp
as
select *
from employee natural join dept


create or replace view emp
as
select max(salary) as max_sal
from employee

create or replace view emp
as
select dept,max(salary) as max_sal
from employee
group by dept

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

				Session 9: 8th Sept., 2020
DML operations on view

insert
delete
update

create or replace view emp
as
select id,name,dept
from employee

insert operation:

insert into emp values(8,'Sanjay','MKT')


delete operation:

Syntax:

delete from emp
where id=8


Update operation:
change name of employee as amita whose id as 1


update emp
set name='amita'
where id=1


DML opearions cannot be performed on view in following conditions:

---- if view contains group functions, group by clause
e.g.


create or replace view emp
as
select dept, max(salary) as max_sal
from employee
group by dept


insert into emp values('Sales',2000).........not possible because max_sal colm not present in employee table


---if view contains joins 


create or replace view emp
as
select *
from employee natural join dept


insert into emp(id,name,salary) values(8,'sanjay',3000).....not possible

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			Set operators

union
union all
intersect
minus

1. union: it is used to display data from first table or second table but repeated entries display only once

depositor

create table depositor
(id number(2) primary key,
name varchar2(20),
balance number(7,2))



create table borrower
(id number(2) primary key,
name varchar2(20),
loan number(7,2))


select id,name from borrower
union
select id,name from depositor

2. union all: It is same as union but it display duplicate rows also

select id,name from borrower
union all
select id,name from depositor

3. intersect

It is used to display data which is present in both tables

e.g.

display those employees having bank account as well as taken a loan from bank
select id,name from borrower
intersect
select id,name from depositor

4. minus: It is used to display data from 1st table but not from second table or vice versa

minus
select id,name from borrower

Q. Display those cust taken loan but not having account

select id,name from borrower
minus
select id,name from depositor

savepoint marker;

e.g.

savepoint A;

e.g.

insert...
commit;
insert........
update......
savepoint A
delete....
insert .......
savepoint B
update.....
rollback  .....it rollback all the DML oprns after last commit

rolback to A
rolback to B
