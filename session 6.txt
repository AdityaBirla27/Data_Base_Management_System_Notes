Session 6

Subquery

A query inside another query is called as subquery

Syntax:

select col_names.................................outer query
from table_name
where col_name operator (select col_name
			from table_name
			where condition) ............ inner query

first inner query will be executed and o/p of inner query will be given to outer query.

Final result will be provided by outer query

Q. display those employees whose salary is more than 3000

select *
from employee
where salary>3000

Q. display those employees whose salary is more than amit salary
select *
from employee
where salary > (select salary
		from employee
		where name='amit')


2 types of subqeury:

1. single row subquery:
It returns only one value to the outer query.
<, <=, >, >=, =, <> (!=)  (single row operators)


e.g.

select *
from employee
where salary > (select salary
		from employee
		where name='amit')

2. multiple row subquery

It returns more than one values.

It uses in, any, all ......(multiple row operators)

e.g.
display those employees whose salary is more than employees working in mkt dept.

select *
from employee
where salary > all(select salary
		from employee
		where dept='MKT')


Q. display those employees whose salary is same as those employees working in mkt dept.


select *
from employee
where salary in(select salary
		from employee
		where dept='MKT')

OR

select *
from employee
where salary =any(select salary
		from employee
		where dept='MKT')

Note:

U must use relational operator with any and all

Is it possible to use more than 2 subqueries?

Q. display those employees whose salary is more than amit salary and those employees working in MKT dept

select *
from employee
where salary >(select salary
		from employee
		where name='amit')
and
salary >all(select salary
		from employee
		where dept='MKT')


Q. Can i use different tables in outer and inner query?

create table department
(dept varchar2(20) primary key,
location varchar2(20))


Q.display those employees who are working in mumbai department

select *
from employee
where dept in(select dept
              from department
              where location='Mumbai')


Q. display those employees who are working in mumbai dept and salary more than mkt dept employees

select *
from employee

              from department
              where location='Mumbai')
